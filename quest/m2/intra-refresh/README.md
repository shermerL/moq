# Intra-refresh GOPs

## Goal

Video encoded with periodic intra refresh has no keyframes. Each frame refreshes
a stripe of the picture, so a decoder that starts at the beginning of a sweep is
clean once the sweep completes, and the bitrate never spikes. This questline
makes such video a first-class hang broadcast on import and playback: streams
contributed that way import cleanly, and every viewer tunes in without a
visible glitch.

Measured on 2026-10-06: at fixed quality, a 60s keyframe interval saves
10-16% against 2s on the 240p-720p rungs and about 10% at 1080p (x264
veryfast, zerolatency, scene-cut detection off). Almost all of that saving is
already at 10s. A 60s group costs the joiner a full GOP of catch-up decode,
about 4s at 1080p on one desktop thread, and a full GOP of bytes. Encoder
refresh mode does not pay for that. Import and playback stay here because
contributed feeds already use intra refresh.

The motivations, in the order they settle tradeoffs: a flat bitrate at low
latency, so a bandwidth grant holds; faster tune-in, since a short refresh cycle
is a short group and the recovery time overlaps the latency buffer instead of
adding to it; and contribution compatibility with hardware encoders and
broadcast feeds that only do intra refresh.

Decisions the quests share:

- One group per refresh cycle. A group starts at the recovery point, the frame
  that begins a sweep, so a viewer joining at any group boundary is clean after
  exactly one cycle and relay shedding keeps its meaning.
- The catalog carries a `warmup` duration per rendition. Decoded output stamped
  within `warmup` of a group start is not presented after a non-continuous
  join, and a subscriber joins that much further back so the first presented
  frame lands at the latency target. The field is generic: audio gets the same
  one for Opus convergence.
- A viewer never shows a partially refreshed picture: cold tune-in and a
  mid-stream skip both decode everything and present nothing until recovery,
  freezing on the last good frame. A group that opens on a true IDR shows at
  once.
- H.264 and H.265 only. AV1 and VP9 have no standard gradual refresh signal.
  WebCodecs has no intra-refresh option, so js/publish is consumer-only.

## Required

- [Consumer warmup](/quest/m2/intra-refresh/consumer-warmup.md) - JS and Rust viewers join `warmup` earlier and withhold display until recovery, except at a true IDR
- [H.264 import](/quest/m2/intra-refresh/h264-import.md) - the splitter keeps `recovery_frame_cnt` and import publishes `warmup` from it
- [H.265 import](/quest/m2/intra-refresh/h265-import.md) - the splitter reads the recovery-point SEI so an HEVC intra-refresh stream forms groups and publishes `warmup`
- [Export sync flags](/quest/m2/intra-refresh/export-sync-flags.md) - fmp4, MKV, and HLS stop advertising a refresh group start as a sync sample

- [Audio warmup](/quest/m1/audio-warmup.md) - Opus convergence after a mid-stream join uses the same `warmup` field
- [Open-GOP leading pictures](/quest/m1/open-gop-leading-pictures.md) - frames stamped before the group's keyframe are the other tune-in trim
