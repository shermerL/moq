# Configuration

`moq-relay relay.toml`. Every key is also a CLI flag and environment variable
that joins the section and key: `listen.tls.cert` is `--listen-tls-cert` /
`MOQ_LISTEN_TLS_CERT`. The exception is `listen.bind`, spelled `--listen` /
`MOQ_LISTEN`. Precedence is CLI, then env, then file, then defaults.
`moq-relay --help` lists every flag.

## \[listen]

```toml
[listen]
bind = "[::]:443"                    # QUIC (UDP), as --listen. Omit for a stream-only relay.
version = ["moq-lite-05"]            # Restrict accepted versions. Omit for all.
timeout = "10s"                      # Handshake deadline. "0" waits forever.

[listen.tls]
cert = "cert.pem"                    # Certificate chain and key. Reloaded on change.
key = "key.pem"
generate = ["localhost"]             # Or: a self-signed cert for development.
root = ["peer-ca.pem"]               # Optional: CAs for client certs (mTLS), reported to the auth server. Needs QUIC.

[listen.tcp]                         # Plaintext qmux over TCP for trusted local workers.
bind = "127.0.0.1:4444"
# tls = true                         # Or: qmux over TLS (tls://) with the listen certificate, no client certs.

[listen.unix]                        # Plaintext qmux over a Unix socket, gated by peer credentials.
bind = "/run/moq/internal.sock"
allow.uid = [1001]
```

`timeout` bounds the whole handshake, transport through MoQ SETUP, so a peer
that connects and never speaks is closed instead of held open by keep-alives.
The `io_uring` workers do not apply it.

A setting no configured listener reads stops startup rather than being ignored.
A stream-only relay refuses `preferred_v4`, `preferred_v6`, and `lb_id` (or `load_balancer`), which
only QUIC reads, and a `[listen.tls]` `cert`, `key`, or `generate` unless
`tcp.tls` serves it.
`lb_nonce` needs `lb_id`. `lb_id` and `lb_nonce` cannot be combined with `load_balancer`.
`unix.allow` needs `unix.bind`.

## \[quic]

Transport tuning, applied to accepted and dialed connections alike.

```toml
[quic]
congestion_control = "delay"         # "delay" (BBR, the default) or "loss" (CUBIC).
max_streams = 10000                  # Concurrent streams per connection, bidi and uni. Default.
idle_timeout = "10s"                 # Drop a connection after this long with nothing on it. Default.
keep_alive = "3s"                    # Ping interval; "0s" disables it. Ignored by iroh. Default.
gso = true                           # UDP segmentation offload. iroh cannot turn it off.
mtu_discovery = false                # Path MTU discovery. Default.
receive_window = 67108864            # Whole-connection window, in bytes. Default (64 MiB).
stream_receive_window = 8388608      # Per-stream window. Omit for the backend default.
send_window = 33554432               # Unacknowledged outgoing data. Omit for the backend default.
qlog = "/var/log/moq/qlog"           # Existing directory. Needs the `qlog` build feature.
```

`idle_timeout` is how long a peer that vanished without a close keeps its
sessions, and so its [cluster routes](/bin/relay/cluster#failure-detection).
QUIC uses the smaller of the two endpoints' values, so this also bounds the
other end. Keep `keep_alive` under a third of it.

Raise the receive windows when a fat, long path idles below the link rate. The
64 MiB `receive_window` default carries several Gbps at a 100 ms RTT and bounds
how much unread data one peer can make the relay buffer. Keep
`stream_receive_window` well under it so one slow group cannot starve the
connection.

## \[runtime]

By default one work-stealing runtime serves every connection off one UDP
socket. On Linux, QUIC can instead run on pinned single-threaded workers, each
with its own socket on the listen address (`SO_REUSEPORT`), so a connection is
handled start to finish by one thread and its packets never cross cores.

```toml
[runtime]
workers = 8                          # Single-threaded QUIC workers. Omit for the shared runtime.
pin = true                           # Pin each worker to a core. Default.
io_uring = false                     # Drive them with io_uring instead of tokio.
```

Packets are steered by connection ID, so a client that migrates stays with its
worker. `workers` needs the `noq` feature and real certificate files rather
than `tls.generate`. `io_uring` additionally needs Linux 6.12+, the `io-uring`
cargo feature, and exactly one certificate; it serves moq-lite only, and
refuses `mtu_discovery`. A setting the build or host cannot deliver refuses to
start rather than being ignored. If io\_uring workers fail to start naming
`RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`, raise it (`LimitMEMLOCK=` under systemd).

## \[web]

```toml
[web.http]
listen = "[::]:4443"                 # HTTP: fingerprint, announced, fetch, health.

[web.https]
listen = "[::]:443"                  # HTTPS plus the WebSocket fallback.
cert = "cert.pem"                    # cert, key, and root need listen.
key = "key.pem"

[internal]
listen = "127.0.0.1:9101"            # Unauthenticated /health, /metrics, /nodes, /sessions, POST /sessions/revalidate. Keep private.
```

See [HTTP endpoints](/bin/relay/http).

## \[auth]

```toml
[auth]
# Exactly one of these:
url = "http://127.0.0.1:4440/"       # An auth server asked once per session event (`moq auth serve`,
                                     # or your own). https:// presents connect.tls; unix:// is a socket.
# public = "anon/**"                 # Or a static anonymous grant rooted at /, publish and subscribe alike.
# public_subscribe = ["anon/**", "demo/**"]   # Or split them; patterns, `foo/**` for a subtree.
# public_publish = ["anon/**"]
```

See [Authentication](/bin/relay/auth).

## \[cluster]

```toml
[cluster]
connect = ["https://us-east.example.com/?cost=10"]   # Peers to dial. ?cost prices the link, or use {url, cost, egress, token, upstream} objects.
node = "https://us-west.example.com/"                 # This relay's own URL.
# connect_api_tls_root = ["api-ca.pem"]              # Private API roots, independent from connect.tls.
connect_api = "https://api.example.com/peers"        # Or fetch the peer list (JSON array of URLs and/or objects) live.
token = "cluster.jwt"                                 # JWT for dials without an inline ?jwt=.
id = 12345                                            # Stable Hop ID across restarts.

[cluster.lan]                                         # Find peers on the LAN over mDNS.
enabled = true
# secret = "/etc/moq/cluster.key"                     # Optional: 64 hex chars, or a file holding them.
# app = "default"                                     # DNS-SD subtype; moq-cli shares this name.
```

See [Clustering](/bin/relay/cluster).

## \[connect]

Settings for outbound dials (cluster peers, auth API).

```toml
[connect]
timeout = "30s"                      # Dial plus handshake. "0" waits forever.
tls.root = ["ca.pem"]                # Trust these CAs (replaces system roots unless system_roots = true).
tls.cert = "relay.pem"               # Present a client certificate (mTLS to peers and the auth API).
tls.key = "relay.key"
goaway.redirect = "same-host"        # How far to trust a draining peer's redirect URI.
goaway.handover = "10s"              # Cap on how long the drained upstream keeps serving.
```

A draining upstream may name a replacement URI. `same-host` follows it only
onto the host already dialed, so a peer can move us between ports and schemes;
`follow` also lets it choose the host, which trusts it not to point us into
the local network; `ignore` keeps the current address. `handover` caps how long
the old connection keeps serving after a GOAWAY.

## \[cache]

```toml
[cache]
capacity = "8GiB"                    # Target bytes of cached groups. "75%" of memory also works.
headroom = "2GiB"                    # Or: keep this much system memory free and grow into the rest.
duration = "30s"                     # Cap how long a non-latest group is kept, whatever the publisher asked.
```

`capacity` is a byte target, repaid as active publishers write. `duration`
(30s by default) bounds memory by age, and sweeps on a timer, so a publisher
that stalls but stays connected still has its idle groups reclaimed. The latest
group of every track is always kept, even past `capacity`.

## \[stats]

```toml
[stats]
enabled = true
prefix = ".stats"                    # Broadcasts appear under <prefix>/node/<node>.
interval = 1                         # Seconds between snapshots.
node = "sjc/1"                       # Disambiguates relays sharing a cluster.
depth = 1                            # Also bucket by the first N path segments (per tenant).
linger = "5m"                        # Keep an empty group's broadcast announced this long. Default.
```

Each node publishes its traffic and session counters as MoQ tracks, split by a
**tier** label from the auth server's grant (`--cluster-tier` for links this
relay dials and LAN peers it admits), which is what makes billing per customer or per region possible.
Each run, and each group returning after its linger, announces under a fresh
[epoch](/concept/moq-lite#publisher-epochs), so a restart is a new broadcast at
the same path. Session rows report how close sessions come to the per-session
limits, past which one is closed with `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`. [Stats](/concept/stats) describes the paths, tracks, and
encodings; read them with the [`moq-stats`](https://docs.rs/moq-stats) crate.

## \[iroh]

Iroh requires building the relay from source with `cargo build --release -p moq-relay --features iroh`. Published binaries, Docker images, and the Nix package leave it out.

```toml
[iroh]
enabled = true
secret = "./iroh-secret.key"         # Persist the key so the endpoint id survives restarts.
# disable_relay = true               # Direct addresses only. Right on a LAN, wrong on the internet.
```

See [Transport](/concept/transport#iroh-peer-to-peer-experimental).

## Shutdown

```toml
drain_timeout = "10s"                # Top-level key, as --drain-timeout / MOQ_DRAIN_TIMEOUT.
```

The first SIGTERM or SIGINT starts a drain: every session is sent a GOAWAY
asking it to reconnect elsewhere, including any that connect during the drain,
and is force-closed if it is still connected when the window ends. The relay
exits as soon as every session has left, when the window ends, or immediately
on a second signal. `0` skips the GOAWAY. Only moq-lite-04+ and moq-transport
clients act on a GOAWAY; older ones are closed when the window ends. An
embedder can take over the signals; see [Embed](/bin/relay/#embed).

## \[log]

```toml
[log]
level = "info"                       # RUST_LOG overrides this.
```

At `info` the relay logs a `listening` record with the bound address for each
QUIC and public `[web]` listener, so a port of `0` reports the port the OS
picked.

```
INFO listening addr=[::]:4443 kind=quic
INFO listening addr=[::]:4443 kind=http
```
