The audio half of a native call: microphone in, hang track out, speaker at
the far end. `moq import capture` and `moq play` use it. There is no C
toolchain or codec package to install, apart from ALSA headers on Linux when
capture or playback is enabled.

| Module | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `capture` | Microphones via CoreAudio, WASAPI, ALSA (and PipeWire/PulseAudio hosts), plus macOS system audio |
| `encode` | PCM to Opus (mono or stereo, with DTX and voice activity) or raw PCM |
| `decode` | Opus (up to 7.1), PCM, and AAC-LC (mono or stereo) back to PCM, resampled to the rate you want |
| `playback` | One output device mixing every track in a call, with click-free volume ramps |
| `aec` | Acoustic echo cancellation (a port of WebRTC's), so a laptop with no headset doesn't feed itself back |

The microphone opens only while someone listens, and can be swapped without
changing the track subscribers know. Opus packs 20 ms per packet by default,
or 10 ms with the low-latency preset. Groups carry at least 20 ms by default,
so the low-latency preset pairs packets. `encode::Options::group_duration`
changes that minimum; zero puts every packet in its own group. Longer groups
mean fewer streams per relay but coarser loss. There is no AAC encoder, so an
AAC encode request is refused; AAC decode is for broadcasts from the ingest gateways.

Playback writes never block: samples that do not fit are dropped and
reported, and retrying them would only add latency. Voice activity is read off the Opus
stream, so a call UI needs no second detector. Echo cancellation pairs one
playback engine with one live microphone. A microphone buffer is stamped at
the capture instant of its first sample, so it lines up with video acquired
then: up to 10 ms later with echo cancellation on, and at the read time on a
host with no usable capture timestamp.

```bash
cargo add moq-audio --features playback
cargo add moq-audio --features capture,playback,aec    # Linux: cpal links libasound
cargo add moq-audio --features capture,pipewire
```

`pipewire` and `pulseaudio` only take effect alongside `capture` or `playback`.

API: [docs.rs/moq-audio](https://docs.rs/moq-audio). Pair with
[`moq-video`](/lib/rs/moq-video). The playout target `moq play` and
`<moq-watch>` share is [audio jitter](/concept/audio-jitter).
