//! One rendition's view of the broadcast's segments, as a `Producer`/[`Consumer`] pair.
//!
//! Segments are derived from one reference rendition's timeline: each of its records is a
//! segment, numbered by the record's sequence. The catalog watcher reads that timeline and fans
//! each record out to every rendition as a row: the segment's number and timing, plus the
//! reference record's frames. Each rendition resolves a row against its own timeline. Two things
//! read the window:
//!
//! * the HTTP serve path, synchronously, to render a media playlist and resolve a segment's
//!   frames (nothing here touches media bytes on that path); and
//! * a [`Consumer`] cursor, for a recorder that wants every segment *with its media*, in
//!   order, exactly once. `next()` waits for the next resolved row, FETCHes and transmuxes its
//!   frames (via [`Rendition`]), and yields the CMAF bytes.
//!
//! A segment is addressed by its reference's tag and its number (the `seg/{tag}.{segment}.m4s`
//! URI); the number alone is its `EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` and the recorder cursor's position. The
//! same URI names the same span of content time on every rendition, on every edge, and after
//! every reload. Each reference numbers segments by its own records, so a new reference starts a
//! new numbering under its own tag rather than reusing the old one's URIs.
