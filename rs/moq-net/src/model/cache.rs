//! A shared byte budget for cached groups, repaid by write-time eviction.
//!
//! Every group charges its cached bytes into a [`Pool`] through a crate-internal
//! `Charge`, billed to its track's `Track` account. The pool itself never evicts: it is
//! a handful of atomic counters. While the pool is over capacity, each track accrues
//! eviction debt as it writes (`accrue`),
//! sized proportionally to what it wrote, and pays that debt by aborting its own oldest
//! groups with [`Error::Evicted`](crate::Error::Evicted). Reclamation is therefore
//! distributed across every writing track and converges on the capacity without any
//! global eviction task.
//!
//! Cross-track ordering comes from one statistic: the mean last-access time of the
//! evictable population (every cached group except each live track's protected latest).
//! A group accessed more recently than that mean is never evicted, so freshly read
//! or fetched content in one track can't die while another track holds staler
//! content, and a track
//! whose oldest group is staler than the mean accrues debt at double rate. Evicting
//! old entries and inserting new ones both advance the mean, so the eviction
//! frontier moves with cache turnover on its own.
//!
//! The pool also owns the wall-clock LRU window ([`Pool::expiry`]): a group that
//! nobody has read or written for that long is reclaimed, no matter what retention
//! its track advertises. Only a live track's latest group is exempt: once a track
//! ends, a stale consumer can't pin any of it. Track retention
//! ([`max_age`](crate::track::Info::max_age)) is measured in media timestamps, so a
//! congestion stall can't age content out; the pool's expiry is the orthogonal
//! wall-clock bound that keeps unwatched content from pinning RAM.
//!
//! Expiry is driven by [`Pool::gc`], also called by each origin driver.
//! Reads and writes clear the expiration timestamp without reading a clock.
//! The next cleanup pass dates that activity at its supplied instant. Delayed
//! cleanup extends retention; standalone pools must call `gc` too.
//! Byte-pressure eviction still runs inline on writes.
//!
//! A bare pool is inert by default ([`Pool::unbounded`]): publishers and subscribers
//! that never set a capacity or expiry pay only a couple of atomic counters, and
//! register nothing. A standalone [`origin`](crate::origin::Config) enables
//! [`DEFAULT_EXPIRY`], while a relay creates one configured pool and shares it across
//! every origin so the whole process caches into a single policy.
