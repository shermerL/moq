## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Auth requests distinguish `webtransport` from native `quic`. Upgrade auth servers before relays: older servers reject the new value. Rust and JavaScript auth parsers now map future transport names to `unknown`.

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/compare/moq-auth-v0.2.0...moq-auth-v0.2.1) - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- *(auth,hang)* out-of-range auth durations and catalog walls no longer panic ([#4600](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/4600))

- *(auth)* [**breaking**] one type per contract concept ([#3776](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3776))

- [**breaking**] refuse released spellings and drop unused deprecated APIs ([#3719](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3719))
- *(relay)* admit every session through a moq-auth lease ([#3688](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3688))
- *(auth)* moq auth serve is the reference auth server ([#3686](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3686))
- *(auth)* moq-auth and @moq/auth own the contract and the token ([#3684](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3684))

### Fixed

- *(auth)* end a session when a re-check no longer grants ([#3774](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3774))

### Added

- `Request`, `Grant`, and `Event`: the JSON contract between a relay and an auth server.
- `lease::{Producer, Consumer}`: the handle a session holds for the grant that admitted it.
- `Client`: the HTTP implementation, driving a lease against `--auth-url`.
- `lease::Consumer::revalidate` asks the producer to re-check now; `Producer::{poll_revalidate, revalidate_requested}` resolve once per burst. A fixed lease is a no-op. The HTTP client POSTs at once when idle or in backoff, and once more when a nudge arrives during an in-flight re-check.
- `lease::Reason::Invalid`: a re-check whose grant fails validation (`end.reason` is `invalid`).

### Fixed

- A re-check that answers 401 or a 2xx that fails `Grant::validate` ends the session instead of retrying until `expires`.
- `Grant::validate` and the lease expiry deadline tolerate a few seconds of clock skew.

### Breaking

- `Counters` is gone. `Client::connect` takes only the request; `lease::Consumer::close(reason, bytes)` reports the totals, and `Drop` reports zero. `Producer::closed` returns `(Reason, Bytes)`.
- `Request::new(node, transport, path)` mints the session id; the four-argument form and `Request::connect` are gone.
- An `oct` JWK without `kty` is refused rather than defaulted.
- `serve::Rules` is gone; `Policy.public` and `Policy.mtls` are `Permissions`.
- `serve::Policy::decide` authorizes a token at the dialed path with `Claims::authorize` and grants the residuals, instead of refusing when `root != path`.

### Changed

- Renamed from `moq-token`. `Claims` and `Scope` carry `moq-pattern` unions under `publish` and `subscribe`; the prefix-shaped `put` and `get` fields are refused.
- `Claims::authorize` returns pattern residuals instead of prefixes.
