	/// the whole uplink. Pass the same allocator to both.
	///
	/// Defaults to [`Allocator::unlimited`](moq_net::bandwidth::Allocator::unlimited),
	/// which reserves nothing and leaves every sender at its configured rate.
	///
	/// Audio reserves but does not follow its share: Opus can retune live and PCM

	/// stalls the rest of its group until retransmitted. Packets still forward as
	/// they are encoded rather than buffered until the group fills. A longer
	/// [`Settings::frame_duration`] (up to 60 ms for Opus) also packs more audio
