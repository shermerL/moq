//! [`Import`] reads a TS byte stream, reassembles PES packets per PID, and

//! legacy MP2/AC-3/E-AC-3 verbatim path), which own their broadcast tracks and
//! catalog entries. Elementary streams we don't decode are carried verbatim, one
//! MoQ track per PID, described in the `mpegts` catalog section: PES-framed streams
//! ride the normal PES reassembly, while section-framed streams (SCTE-35 and
